### Background
Currently a man in his late 40s, Wilbard Drake was born in the city of Galethspyre to a family who's lineage
has a deep background of Military service. As a middle class family the Drakes could afford to send Wilbard
to the local military school where he showed significant promise from an early age in the art of combat and
tactics. As he grew, so did his skills with a sword, shield, and infiltration; but as a boy who's head was often in the clouds
he dreamed one day of becoming a grand wizard among the highest towers of Sharn. Because of this, young Drake
spent what little free time he was allowed studying the secrets of the arcane in the various libraries of 
Galethspyre.

With the small amount of time he had to himself progress was slow, but as he aged his skills
as a magic wielder began to come to fruition. One day at the age of 18, and in the final years of his 
schooling Wilbard was set to spar with a class rival of his. Having been bested by him before, Drake was 
determined to beat his rival and decided to use his knowledge of the arcane to give himself the edge. After 
enduring a particularly rough series of blows while not making much headway himself, Drake cast True Strike
under his breath and made his way to attack. Given the nature of the spell, Drake's blade saw its way past
his rival's defenses and through a weak point in his armor while accidentally dealing a mortal blow.

Rather than be punished for cheating, his superiors saw his potential and to protect him simply chalked his 
rivals death up to a training accident. Shortly afterward Drake was conscripted into the Redcloak Battalion.
Considered a great honor among anyone from Breland and especially so within his own family, Wilbard was in
no position to decline his new station. For the next two years Wilbard was forced into an even more rigorous
training program not only in the art of combat and stealth but the ways of the arcane as well. On one hand
he was forced into the same old shit he experienced through his life, but on the other was given proper access
to knowledge of the arcane and the means to study it.

At the age of 20, with his formal training finally complete he is sent on his first missions as a fully 
fledged member of the Redcloaks.

- Exceptionally capable with violence, quickly rose through the ranks.

- Power adjacent, saw the true influence wielded by the houses at the expense of the people.
  - Commanded to take on a mission benefiting only a house, many of his men died.

- As Darguun declares Independence Jeeves gets caught holding Marguul pass. Drake, now a Lt saves him and his
  regiment. Never really meet.

  - Any opportunity to steal from or hurt the merchant guilds, and use the proceeds to the people's benefit
  He's up for.
