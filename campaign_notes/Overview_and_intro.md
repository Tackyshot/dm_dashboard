# Campaign Introduction and Overview

Welcome Adventurers to the world of Eberron!

## State of the World

## Awesome new Features, Races, & Classes in Eberron!

### New Features:
  - **Group Patrons:**
  - **Dragonmarks:**
  - **Dragonshards:**
  
### Races:
This is Eberron, a world very different than that of Faerûn and the races of the continent
reflect that. Inside the campaign setting you will find three new Player races:
  - **Warforged:**
    - Sentient Suits of magical armor that were built in the creation forges developed by
    House Cannith. These Forges were destroyed as a requirement to the passing of the Treaty
    of Thronehold so new Warforged are no longer capable of being built.
    - Originally they were crafted for the purposes of war and war only, and since the war's 
    end many Warforged wander the continent in search of a place to call home.
  - **Changelings:**
    - The origins of these creatures are steeped deeply in the lore of the Traveler, yet
    nobody really knows how these changelings came to be. As creatures capable of changing 
    their features as easily as someone might change their clothes, Changelings are often 
    seen with suspicion and mistrust.
    - This race lends exceptionally well to rogues, and other classes where stealth and 
    subterfuge is of utmost importance.
  - **Shifters:**
    - Part animal and part human, shifters have evolved into their own unique race. While
    their origins are a mystery many people believe them to be descendants of lycanthropes
    - Often found in more rural areas rather than large cities they have a deep connection
    to the "beast within" and often embrace their own animalistic heritage.
    - However, as a race torn between two worlds everyday life in society isn't always easy.
    Will your shifter embrace its human aspects and civilization, or will they gravitate
    towards their more animalistic nature?
  - **Kalashtar:**
  
### Classes:
  - Artificer
    - Half engineer and half magician, this class specializing in the research, development,
    and duplication of various magical items and contraptions. Artificers built the Creation
    Forges of house Cannith. Artificers discovered how to bind elementals to create airships
    and lighting rails. Artificers are responsible for some of the most important discoveries
    that made Eberron such a magical world, and may even be responsible for the destruction
    of the Nation of Cyre.
  
### Gods and Religion:

The Faiths of Eberron are significantly different than those of Faerûn. As a result the role
the gods play in your character's backstory and motivations might look entirely different
from previous campaigns. Below are a list of the various religions that exist within
the world of Eberron. More specific information can be found starting on page 141 of the
Eberron Campaign setting for 5e.

  - **Sovereign Host**
    - Dominant religion through most of the five nations, holds sway over most of Khorvair
    (Except Thrane)
  - **Dark Six**
    - The Evil Gods that Oppose the Sovereign Host. Often Worshipped by Aberrations, Fiends,
    and Fey.
  - **Church of the Silver Flame**
    - The Predominant religion of Thrane, They Worship the sacrifice of Tira Miron who bound
    her soul to the silver flame so as to banish an ancient and powerful demon. She now acts
    as the voice of the light to guide all to her flame who would listen.
  - **Blood of Vol**
    - Basically a religion of Nihilistic Atheist Elves from the continent of Aerenal,
    Homeland of the Elves. They study the secrets of blood and life and believe that
    the power of divinity rests within us all.
  - **Cults of the Dragon Below**
    - A blanket term for a diverse group of cults who worship various things but all
    revolving around the Khyber, the Dragon below who struck down his sister Siberys
  - **Path of Light**
    - Often followed by members of the Kalashtar race, they believe that we live in a time
    of darkness and that only by finding the path that leads to the light shall we be saved.
  - **Spirits of the Past**
    - Worship no gods, but rather the spirits of their ancestors. These followers are more
    focused on the deeds and history of their ancestors rather than a specific pantheon of
    dieties.
  - **Undying Court**
    - Worshiped only by the elves on the continent of Aerenal these elves refuse to let 
    their greatest souls be lost to oblivion. Instead, the most accomplished and wisest
    of their kind are preserved in the Undying Court which manifests as a well of magical
    energy to guide and protect their kind.
  - **Druids of Khorvaire**
    - Another blanket term for those who lead vastly different paths. The Druids look after
    the natural world, but do so in different ways. Read the campaign setting for more
    specific information.
