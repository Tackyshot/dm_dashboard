# Location: Woodhelm

## General Info

This small logging town was established by the kingdom of Breland 4 Years ago. Lying at the head of the Dagger
River this town serves as a significant source of lumber both for the city of Sharn, and Galethspyre and most
recently infrastructure fortifications along the border of Droaam. In addition to it's legal activities,
Woodhelm is home to the criminal organization known as "The Visage of Kol Korran." This organization is lead and
operated by Lt. Wilbard Drake who also happens to be the local reagent and was appointed by King Boranel
ir'Wynarn himself as a reward for Drake's years of loyal service as a member and officer of the Redcloak
Battalion. As a logging town deep in The Dragonwood, it is at once close enough to the capital city of Wroat
to be considered safe from the reach of rival nations, deep enough in the wilderness to be away from the prying
eyes of most of the Kingdom. As the headquarters of a criminal organization it provides easy access to smuggling
routes down the dagger river, or north to the black pits and beyond.
